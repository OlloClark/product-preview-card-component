# Product Preview Card

## An elegant item card component challenge from www.frontendmentor.com

This item card was designed according to UX specs on www.frontendmentor.com.

I stuck very closely to the brief, but removed a suggested shopping trolley icon from the button, as I felt it cheapened the look. The button leads nowhere, but I look forward to attaching components like this to more complex projects in the future.

### New Discoveries

Moving out of bootcamp, it was exciting to start trying to level my CSS abilities up to a professional standard. Creating this card was a great example of learning-as-you-go, and, as simple as it is, there was real satisfaction in creating something beautiful and accurate.

### Technologies

* HTML5.
* Vanilla CSS3.

### Current goals moving forward:

* Refactor into a React component for ease of reuse.
* Optimize for smaller screens and mobile.
* Add animated "added to card" notification on button click.
